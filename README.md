# Bruno's notes
- I’m on a tight schedule so no time to do the bonus points
- I have some ideas to have a UI with nice animations, I’ll make some room to do it
- For the offline capability, if we are starting a project from scratch I would suggest using [hydrated_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/hydrated_bloc) instead of provider
# KiWi Flutter Challenge

The purpose of this challenge will be to create a Pokedex using the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/).

You're totally free to do whatever design you want so feel free to use your creativity!

You must use the same packages as we use internally, here is the list:

- [state_notifier](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_state_notifier)
- [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) (optional)
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
- [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)

Feel free to use any other package you like that doesn't conflict with those ones.

You should at least create a list/details (where details is an editable form with validation but no API call as it is readonly).

*Bonus point for searching capabilities*

*Bonus point offline capabilities*

*Bonus point if [openapi](https://www.openapis.org) and [generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) are used for the networking part*

There is no time limit, without bonuses it should take you between 3 and 4h to have something acceptable.

We will judge the code, the architecture and general design/fluidity of the app.
